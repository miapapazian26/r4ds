# 2.5 exercises: workflow basics 

# 1: the code doesn't work because the coder typed in "my_var1able" and not "my_variable" 
# 2: a) library(tidyverse)
# b) ggplot(data = mpg) +
#     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
#     geom_smooth(method = "lm")
# 3: this key combo brings up the keyboard shortcuts help dialog. if you navigate to the help button on the files pane, we can pull up the same menu. 
# 4: the plot that is saved as "mpg.plot.png" is the bar plot. this is due to the ggsave function being used, where the filename is "mpg-plot.png" and the plot assignment is my_bar_plot

# 5.2.1 exercises 
# 1: in the first table example, the table shows the rate of cases per 10,000 people for different countries and years. the country column represents the name of the country, the year column represents the year in which the data was recorded, the cases column represents the number of reported cases in that country for that year, the population column gives the total population of the country for that year, and the rate column gives us the rate of cases per 10,000 people 
# in the second table example, the table summarizes the total number of cases reported per year, over all countries. the year gives the total number of cases reported, and the total_cases is the total number of cases reported for that year, summed across all countries
# in the third table example, the plot visualizes the number of cases changing over time in different countries. year represents the x-axis, cases reported represent the y-axis, group = country represents the trend over time, where each country is represented by its own line, color = country visually assigns each country a color, making it easier to differentiate trends, shape = country assigns different shapes for points that represent different countries, and scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2000)) customizes the x-axis so that there are breaks at the years 1999 and 2000  
# 2: a) extract the number of TB cases, we can use select to focus on the columns country, year, and cases 
# b)
